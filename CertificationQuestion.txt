Lab Objective
The objective of this lab is to offer students an opportunity to obtain a Python Certification from Alta3 Research. This certification should work as proof of basic proficiency with Python. To do so, simply complete the following tasks.

Certification submissions may be made at anytime.

If you find your environment shutdown, and want a new environment, email support@alta3.com. Include the course name of the course you took so the proper corresponding environment may be created.

How to submit is described below.

Procedure
Create a public repository on GitHub called alta3research-python-cert

Inside of the public repository should be a script called, alta3research-pythoncert01.py

Be sure to observe best practice. Some things to think about:

- Include a shebang
- Include documentation at the top
- Comment your code so it is clear
- Most scripts should have a main()
- Your script should demonstrate proficiency with a library that needs an import. 

This could be something from the standard library, like, json, or csv. 
Alternatively, it could be a library available from https://pypi.org such as pandas, 
requests or any other library you may have discovered. Some suggestions include:

- Make an API request to https://api.nasa.gov and display some portion of the data returned in an easily read format
- Use matplotlib to produce a graph
- Write a guessing game that uses the crayons library to post in green YOU WIN when the correct answer is supplied
- Use pandas to create a dataframe, and export some data into a format of your choice

Anything else you find interesting!
It should be clear how to run your code. If there are any special steps or prerequisites, be sure they are explained in within the script and the README.md within your GitHub repository.

Your code should run without error when executed with Python 3.x

When you finish, email to info@alta3.com containing the following:
